    While my real life may not be quite seem as appealing at first glance compared to my<br> 
    ficitional one, it is completely fulfilling. I grew up in Farmington, Utah where I <br>
    played basketball for my local highscool. I then went on my mission to New York City, <br>
    and Rome, Italy. When I returened home I began studying at BYU at met my beautiful wife. <br>
    We have been married for 2 months now and it's been such a great blessing.<br><br>
